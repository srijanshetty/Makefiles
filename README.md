#Introduction
A build system using make for C projects

#Usage
Make changes to the following variables in each file and then run

INCL			= 		Header Files in the current Library
ILOCATION		=		Location of the libraries in other folders
SRC				=		The files to be compiled in the current directory
EXE 			=		Name of the final executable
LIBRARY1 		=		Needed libraries
OBJS 			=		Objects inside the libraries

#Acknowledgement
The programs are written by a college senior. I only made the make files
